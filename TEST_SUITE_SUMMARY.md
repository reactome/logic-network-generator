# Test Suite Summary

## Overview

**Status: ✅ All 34 tests passing**

This test suite ensures the logic network generator produces correct biochemical pathway representations with proper edge directionality, AND/OR logic, and transformation semantics.

## Running Tests

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/ -v
```

## Test Coverage

### 1. Unit Tests (`test_logic_network_generator.py`) - 9 tests

Tests for individual helper functions:

**`_assign_uuids`** (3 tests)
- ✅ Creates new UUIDs for new Reactome IDs
- ✅ Reuses existing UUIDs for known Reactome IDs
- ✅ Handles multiple Reactome IDs correctly

**`_determine_edge_properties`** (3 tests)
- ✅ Returns 'and'/'input' for single preceding reaction
- ✅ Returns 'or'/'output' for multiple preceding reactions
- ✅ Handles zero preceding reactions (edge case)

**`_add_pathway_connections`** (3 tests)
- ✅ Adds single connection correctly
- ✅ Creates cartesian product of inputs × outputs
- ✅ Documents edge direction semantics (current behavior)

### 2. AND/OR Logic Tests (`test_and_or_logic.py`) - 4 tests

Verifies correct logic assignment based on user requirements:

- ✅ **Single preceding reaction → AND**: When one source produces a molecule
- ✅ **Multiple preceding reactions → OR**: When 2+ sources produce the same molecule
- ✅ **Three preceding reactions → OR**: Confirms OR for 3+ sources
- ✅ **Zero preceding reactions**: Root reactions have no edges (expected)

**User Requirements Verified:**
- R1→A (OR), R2→A (OR) when multiple sources feed same molecule ✓
- A→R3 (AND) for any molecule going into reaction ✓
- Single edge to any node is AND ✓

### 3. Transformation Semantics Tests (`test_transformation_semantics.py`) - 5 tests

Verifies edges correctly represent biochemical transformations:

- ✅ **A → B**: Single input to single output creates one edge
- ✅ **A + B → C**: Two inputs to one output creates 2 edges (both inputs → output)
- ✅ **A → B + C**: One input to two outputs creates 2 edges (input → both outputs)
- ✅ **A + B → C + D**: Creates 4 edges (cartesian product: 2×2)
- ✅ **Direction verification**: Edges flow input → output (not backwards)

**Key Verification:**
- `source_id` = INPUT molecule (reactant)
- `target_id` = OUTPUT molecule (product)
- Represents transformation direction correctly ✓

### 4. Network Invariants Tests (`test_network_invariants.py`) - 12 tests

Verifies structural properties that should always hold:

**Core Invariants:**
- ✅ **No self-loops**: Main pathway edges never have source_id == target_id
- ✅ **Root inputs**: Only appear as sources, never as targets
- ✅ **Terminal outputs**: Only appear as targets, never as sources

**Connectivity:**
- ✅ **Reachability**: All nodes reachable from root inputs via directed edges

**Logic Consistency:**
- ✅ **AND edges**: Always have edge_type='input'
- ✅ **OR edges**: Always have edge_type='output'
- ✅ **All edges**: Have and_or specified (no missing logic)

**Pathway Properties:**
- ✅ **Positive edges**: Main pathway edges are all 'pos' (activation)
- ✅ **Catalyst/regulator edges**: Don't have AND/OR logic (documented behavior)

**Sanity Checks:**
- ✅ **Network size**: Reasonable number of edges (not empty, not huge)
- ✅ **Molecule count**: Reasonable number of unique molecules
- ✅ **Has roots and terminals**: At least one of each

### 5. Integration Tests (`test_edge_direction_integration.py`) - 2 tests

Tests with synthetic pathway data:

- ✅ **Two-reaction pathway**: R1 → R2 with shared molecule
- ✅ **Distinct molecules**: Verifies no self-loops when molecules transform

**Key Discovery:**
- Self-loops only occur when input == output (same molecule)
- Real pathways have zero self-loops because reactions transform molecules ✓

### 6. Real Data Analysis (`test_actual_edge_semantics.py`) - 2 tests

Analyzes actual pathway_logic_network_69620.csv:

- ✅ **Non-self-loop analysis**: Confirms zero self-loops in real data
- ✅ **Node categorization**: Identifies roots (9), intermediates (2), terminals (11)

**Real Data Validation:**
```
Total edges: 4,995
Self-loops: 0 ✓
Root inputs: 9 (source only)
Terminal outputs: 11 (target only)
Intermediates: 2 (both source and target)
Pattern: roots → intermediates → terminals ✓
```

## What The Tests Prove

### 1. Edge Direction is Correct ✓

Edges represent transformations within reactions:
- INPUT molecules (source_id) → OUTPUT molecules (target_id)
- Direction: reactants → products ✓
- No self-loops (reactions transform molecules) ✓

### 2. AND/OR Logic is Correct ✓

Based on number of preceding reactions:
- Single source → AND relationship ✓
- Multiple sources → OR relationship ✓
- Matches user requirements ✓

### 3. Transformation Semantics are Correct ✓

- Cartesian product of inputs × outputs ✓
- Multiple inputs create multiple edges ✓
- Multiple outputs create multiple edges ✓
- Direction represents causality ✓

### 4. Network Structure is Valid ✓

- No self-loops in main pathway ✓
- Clear root → terminal flow ✓
- Reactions connect through shared molecules ✓
- All nodes reachable from roots ✓

## Test Categories by Purpose

### Correctness Tests
Verify the code produces correct output:
- AND/OR logic tests
- Transformation semantics tests
- Edge direction tests

### Invariant Tests
Verify structural properties that must always hold:
- No self-loops
- Root/terminal node properties
- Logic consistency
- Reachability

### Regression Tests
Catch if changes break existing behavior:
- All unit tests
- Network invariant tests

### Documentation Tests
Document current behavior for future reference:
- Catalyst/regulator edge logic
- Real data analysis

## Coverage Gaps (Future Work)

### Not Yet Tested:
1. **Catalyst edges**: How they connect molecules to reactions
2. **Regulator edges**: Positive/negative regulation logic
3. **Edge cases**:
   - Reactions with no terminal molecules (fully decomposed)
   - Cycles in the network (should not exist?)
   - Disconnected components (multiple pathways?)
4. **Decomposition logic**: Testing set/complex decomposition
5. **Best matching algorithm**: Verifying optimal input/output pairing

### Potential Future Tests:
- Property-based testing (hypothesis library)
- Performance tests (large pathways)
- Comparison with known good pathways
- Round-trip tests (generate → parse → verify)

## Test Maintenance

### When to Update Tests:

1. **Adding new features**: Add corresponding tests first (TDD)
2. **Fixing bugs**: Add regression test that catches the bug
3. **Refactoring**: Tests should still pass (verify no behavior change)
4. **Changing requirements**: Update tests to match new requirements
