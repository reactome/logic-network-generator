"""Tests for network invariants - properties that should always hold.

These tests verify structural properties of the generated networks:
- No self-loops in main pathway edges
- Root inputs are always sources (never targets)
- Terminal outputs are always targets (never sources)
- AND/OR logic is consistent
- Edge direction represents transformations
